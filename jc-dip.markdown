# Journal Club of  the Department of Image Processing 

Welcome to the Journal Club of the Department of Image Processing. Our group meets regularly on Fridays in odd-numbered weeks. Each session is hosted by one of the members and includes an article presentation and reading it thoroughly. The presentation is followed by a discussion.

If you would like to join our club there are three rules to be followed:

1. Every member has to read an article to be presented in advance.
2. Every member has to post online at least three topics that she/he is willing to present as a guest.
3. Every member can give a preferential vote to published topics.
